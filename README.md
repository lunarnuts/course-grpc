### Task #2:
Decide kind of RPC to use (JSON-RPC via HTTP, tcp, XML-RPC, gRPC or any other )
Create both server and client. 
Server must have a support two endpoints "register" and "list"
Client may call "register" with name. Server saves new name and returns ID of the record. If name is already taken, returns error
List end point return whole list of users
Global slice or map is OK to be a storage in this task. DB or saving to file is not requred. It's OK to reset storage on server stop.
